<h3 id="noise-propagation-models">Noise Propagation Models</h3>
<p>Eolyse currently operates on a specialized acoustic propagation model known as Acventum, developed by Delhom Acoustique.</p>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>Acventum is designed to simulate long-range acoustic propagation. It is inspired by the research that led to the development of MGCD and is adapted to serve as an engineering model, akin to ISO9613 and the Harmonoise "point-to-point" models developed by CSTB.</p>
<h4 id="acoustic-phenomena-considered">Acoustic Phenomena Considered</h4>
<p>The model accounts for various forms of acoustic decay phenomena during sound propagation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geometrical Divergence</li>
<li>Atmospheric Attenuation</li>
<li>Ground Effect</li>
<li>Attenuation due to Topography</li>
<li>Atmospheric Refraction affecting the curvature of sound rays</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="distinctive-advantages">Distinctive Advantages</h4>
