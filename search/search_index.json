Wind Turbine Library The Wind Turbine Library is a rich repository of detailed information regarding wind turbines, specifically focusing on their electrical power production and acoustic power levels. This library has been painstakingly built by Delhom Acoustique, collating and organizing data from various manufacturers into a comprehensive, standardized database. Accessing the Library Internal Users : Full access to the Wind Turbine Library is provided to internal users. External Clients : Due to the sensitive nature of the data, external clients must make a specific request for access to the library. You can access the Wind Turbine Library by clicking the button labeled \"Wind Turbine Library\" found under \"Eolyse Projects.\" Using the Library Library List : On entering the library, you are greeted by a list that represents the current state of the library. Searching : Use the search bar to look for specific turbine models. Search works on keywords. Note that each wind turbine name is structured as follows: Model Nominal_Power Serration Hub_Height Data_Sheet_Year_Of_Release Model Details : Clicking on a model will reveal its details, such as the manufacturer, nominal power in MW, hub height, rotor diameter, sawtooth add-on status, domain, and the number of modes. Note : The 'domain' could be public or private. Users can add their custom models, which will initially be set to private. However, you can request an administrator to make a private model public. Data Standardization : All data in the library is standardized to a height wind speed of 10 m using a wind shear coefficient of 0.05 and an air density of 1.225 kg/m\u00b3. Rated Electric Power : Below the general details, you can view and export tables showcasing the rated electrical power by operating mode vs. wind speed class, standardized to 10m. Global Acoustic Power : Data visualizations of global acoustic power by operating mode across different wind speed classes are also available. Acoustic Power Spectrum : The library also provides a data representation of the acoustic power spectrum for each operating mode, offering insights into the spectral distribution of noise generated. Spectrum data are gather on the 1/3 octave frequency band from 50Hz to 10 KHz. Adding Custom Models To add your own custom models, click the \"+\" button at the top right corner of the library page. A form will pop up to guide you through the process of creating a new custom model. Fill the proposed form: Enter the number of modes for the wind turbine plus 1. This additional mode should be designated as the \"Stop\" mode Download the CSV Template: Begin by downloading the CSV template provided by Eolyse. This template is specifically designed to match the expected data format and structure. Fill in the Data: Carefully enter your data into the downloaded template. Ensure that all entries are accurate and comply with the format guidelines. Use a Point for Decimal Separation: When inputting numerical values, particularly those with decimals, use a point (.) as the decimal separator. Avoid using a comma (,) for this purpose, as it may lead to data misinterpretation. Save and Upload the File: After entering all the necessary data, save the file. Then, upload this saved file back to the Eolyse platform. This process ensures compatibility and proper decoding of the data format by the system. Important Notes : Stop Mode: The last mode should be the \"Stop\" mode. For this mode, set the production power and global acoustic level to zero, and set the spectral values to -13.8 dB. Mode Order: When entering multiple modes, it's preferable to list them from the most noisy to the least noisy. Maintenance by Delhom Acoustique The Wind Turbine Library is actively maintained by Delhom Acoustique. This enables us to be highly agile in updating and fixing data, as we have direct access to the database. Simulation Review Creating and managing simulations are essential tasks within Eolyse. This section will guide you through the simulation creation and management process. Creating the First Simulation When a new project is created, the first task is to create a simulation: Navigate to the top-left corner of the screen and click on the \"Simulation\" button. Select \"Create Simulation\" from the dropdown. Important : Please make sure to only use UTF-8 characters in the simulation name, as the system is sensitive to special characters. Accessing Modeling Once a simulation has been created, you'll be granted access to the modeling section for further project development. Managing Simulations Renaming : You can rename a simulation by selecting \"Rename Simulation\" from the \"Simulation\" dropdown menu. Duplicating : To duplicate a simulation, choose \"Duplicate Simulation\" from the same menu. This feature allows you to duplicate only source points or receiver points, or both, providing a convenient way to test variables within a project. Deleting : A simulation can be deleted by selecting the \"Delete Simulation\" option from the dropdown menu. Retrieving IDs : For debugging purposes, the IDs for both the project and the simulation can be retrieved by clicking on the \"Information\" button in the dropdown menu. Overwriting Results : Each simulation is designed to hold only one calculation result per application. As example : re-run a standard calculation in the same simulation, any previous results will be overwritten. To keep results of an application, create a new simulation. Simulation Creation Limitation : For now, their is no limitation on the number of simulation an user can create in the same project. Modeling The Modeling section is where you'll create point sources and receiver points. These points will be used for calculations in the different applications within Eolyse. Adding a Point Source Click the \"Add Source\" button. A form will appear where you'll need to fill out the following fields: Point Name : Unique identifier for the point. Color Group : Color coding for the map display. Coordinates : Localization in the WGS84 coordinate system. Model Source : Choose a wind turbine model from the list. Custom models created in the library will also appear here. Important : All fields must be filled in order to create the point. Adding a Receiver Point Click the \"Add Receiver\" button. Similar to adding a source, a form will appear requiring: Point Name Color Group Coordinates in WGS84 Bulk Import of Points To speed up the process, points can be bulk-imported via CSV: Select \"Import Modeling Points\" from the dropdown menu. Follow the guided steps to create multiple points at once. Managing Points Viewing Point Information : After creation, point details can be accessed from an accordion menu. Note that point elevation (in meters) is automatically calculated using Google Maps Elevation API. Updating and Removing Points : Points can be updated or removed as needed. However, note that the point name is non-editable post-creation as it's linked to the point ID. Exporting Points : Point data can be exported to a CSV file by choosing \"Export Modeling Points\" from the \"Simulation\" dropdown menu. Important Considerations Point IDs : The name of a point is tied to its ID and cannot be modified after creation. If a name change is needed, you must create a new point. Reusability : Points created in this section are used in all calculation applications within the simulation. To use a different configuration, you must create a new simulation. Noise Propagation Models Eolyse currently operates on a specialized acoustic propagation model known as Acventum, developed by Delhom Acoustique. Overview Acventum is designed to simulate long-range acoustic propagation. It is inspired by the research that led to the development of MGCD and is adapted to serve as an engineering model, akin to ISO9613 and the Harmonoise \"point-to-point\" models developed by CSTB. Acoustic Phenomena Considered The model accounts for various forms of acoustic decay phenomena during sound propagation, including: Geometrical Divergence Atmospheric Attenuation Ground Effect Attenuation due to Topography Atmospheric Refraction affecting the curvature of sound rays Distinctive Advantages One of the unique advantages of using Acventum is its specific suitability for acoustic calculations within the wind energy sector. It facilitates the assessment of noise impacts for standard wind speed classes, ranging from 3 m/s to 12 m/s. Validation The model has undergone validation against the Harmonoise model under various conditions of sound propagation. It provides an accurate account of the curvature of sound rays, an important factor in long-distance acoustic propagation. Further Information For those interested in the technical details of the Acventum model, you may directly contact our Delhom Acoustique R&D department for more in-depth discussions. Future Developments We are planning to expand the range of models available for use in Eolyse. The objective is to include other well-known models like Harmonoise and ISO9613 for educational comparisons and broader analytical capabilities. Applications Maps The Maps application in Eolyse offers a straightforward way to visualize the spatial layout of your projects.

Sensitivity The Sensitivity application within the Eolyse workspace is specifically designed to explore the impact of a wind farm under hypothetical variations in background noise levels. It serves as a vital tool for engineers to assess how these variations influence the overall acoustic impact and electrical production of the wind farm. Key Features Recursive Calculation : This feature performs calculations by varying the background noise at each receiver within a range from -5 dB(A) to +5 dB(A). This allows for a comprehensive understanding of how slight changes in background noise can influence the overall noise impact of the wind farm. Optimal Curtailment Plan : The model calculates the noise impact at each receiver and determines an optimal curtailment plan based on the varied background noise levels. Electrical Production Metrics : The global electrical production in MW is displayed according to standard wind speed classes and background noise steps, offering a fuller picture of how noise sensitivity can affect energy production. Benefits This application is an indispensable resource for engineers aiming to understand the sensitivity of a wind farm to changes in background noise. It facilitates data-driven decision-making processes to minimize noise impact while maximizing energy production. Risk The Risk application, within the Eolyse workspace is engineered to evaluate the risk of non-compliance of a wind farm project with noise regulations. It employs the Acventum calculation model for its analysis. Key Features Ambient Noise Deviation : The application calculates the deviations between the ambient noise and regulatory thresholds for each homogeneous class. When the ambient noise value exceeds 35 dB(A), that specific homogeneous class is excluded from the analysis. Impact Noise Deviation : It also calculates the impact noise deviations from regulatory thresholds for each homogeneous class. When the impact noise value is below the regulatory threshold (5 dB(A) during the day; 3 dB(A) at night), the homogeneous class is ignored. Risk Factors Calculation : The risk factors for each remaining homogeneous class are computed based on the equation: R(i) = exp(1 / d_amb(i)) + d_impact(i) Benefits This application offers engineers a quantitative analysis of the non-compliance risk for a wind farm project concerning noise regulations. It enables data-driven decision-making to ensure compliance and minimize the risk of non-compliance. Chronology The Chronology application in the Eolyse workspace is built on the Acventum-timeseries model. It enables calculations based on a time-series data set, facilitating a more detailed analysis of the noise impact of a wind farm over time. Key Features Inputs : The model takes into account wind speed, wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, residual noise (or ambient noise) at each receiver, and the operating modes of each wind turbine. A sample data set can be downloaded for this purpose. The user can also set the time interval for analysis; it is recommended to keep the time interval constant. Operating Modes : The operating modes for wind turbines expect integer values ranging from 0 for the first operating mode N + 1. The weakest Mode should be the mode N. The Mode N + 1 should be the mode Stop. Dates should be entered in the format DD/MM/YY HH:MM. Time-series Analysis : The application calculates the noise impact for each time interval at each receiver. Results are displayed in a noise timeline chart, helping engineers better understand the noise impact according to the time of day or week and identify noise impact patterns. Direct and Inverse Methode : Direct Methode : The input data set considers residual noise; impacts are calculated, and ambient noises are derived. Inverse Methode : The input data set considers ambient noise; impacts are calculated, and residual noises are derived. Special cases where the calculated induced noise level is higher than the measured ambient noise may occur. In these cases, the model assumes a residual noise 10 dB(A) lower than the ambient noise. Benefits This application aids engineers in studying the temporal evolution of the noise impact of a wind farm and making data-driven decisions to minimize noise impact. Mesh The Mesh application within the Eolyse workspace is designed to enable cartographic noise impact mapping for wind farms. Key Features Grid Creation : Users can create a grid of points where the wind farm's noise impact will be calculated. The grid or mesh is limited to 40,000 points and is centered by default on the centroid of the wind farm's layout. Mesh Configuration : Users can adjust the length of the square mesh and its resolution through the parameters \"Mesh Length on X-axis\" and \"Resolution\" in the Mesh parameter panel. Wind Direction & Period : Users can select one wind direction. While topography is currently not available (work in progress), two types of periods\u2014day and night\u2014can be configured. Computation Time : The duration of the calculation depends on both the number of sources and the size of the mesh. Result Visualization Mapbox Integration : The 'Result' sub-tab provides a Mapbox-based map that displays the noise impact on a color scale ranging from 0 to 100 dB(A), in steps of 5 dB(A). Wind Speed Classes : Calculations are run for standardized wind classes between 8 and 12 m/s. Full Screen Mode : A full-screen mode is available, and users can easily take screenshots of the results for inclusion in reports using the Plotly Express screenshot tool located at the top left of the figure. Upcoming Features Topography : Support for topographical data is in the pipeline and will be added soon. Benefits The Mesh application provides a robust tool for mapping the noise impact of wind farms, aiding in data-driven decision-making and reporting.
