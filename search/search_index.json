Sensitivity The Sensitivity application within the Eolyse workspace is specifically designed to explore the impact of a wind farm under hypothetical variations in background noise levels. It serves as a vital tool for engineers to assess how these variations influence the overall acoustic impact and electrical production of the wind farm. Key Features Recursive Calculation : This feature performs calculations by varying the background noise at each receiver within a range from -5 dB(A) to +5 dB(A). This allows for a comprehensive understanding of how slight changes in background noise can influence the overall noise impact of the wind farm. Optimal Curtailment Plan : The model calculates the noise impact at each receiver and determines an optimal curtailment plan based on the varied background noise levels. Electrical Production Metrics : The global electrical production in MW is displayed according to standard wind speed classes and background noise steps, offering a fuller picture of how noise sensitivity can affect energy production. Benefits This application is an indispensable resource for engineers aiming to understand the sensitivity of a wind farm to changes in background noise. It facilitates data-driven decision-making processes to minimize noise impact while maximizing energy production. Risk The Risk application, within the Eolyse workspace is engineered to evaluate the risk of non-compliance of a wind farm project with noise regulations. It employs the Acventum calculation model for its analysis. Key Features Ambient Noise Deviation : The application calculates the deviations between the ambient noise and regulatory thresholds for each homogeneous class. When the ambient noise value exceeds 35 dB(A), that specific homogeneous class is excluded from the analysis. Impact Noise Deviation : It also calculates the impact noise deviations from regulatory thresholds for each homogeneous class. When the impact noise value is below the regulatory threshold (5 dB(A) during the day; 3 dB(A) at night), the homogeneous class is ignored. Risk Factors Calculation : The risk factors for each remaining homogeneous class are computed based on the equation: R(i) = exp(1 / d_amb(i)) + d_impact(i) Benefits This application offers engineers a quantitative analysis of the non-compliance risk for a wind farm project concerning noise regulations. It enables data-driven decision-making to ensure compliance and minimize the risk of non-compliance. Chronology The Chronology application in the Eolyse workspace is built on the Acventum-timeseries model. It enables calculations based on a time-series data set, facilitating a more detailed analysis of the noise impact of a wind farm over time. Key Features Inputs : The model takes into account wind speed, wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, residual noise (or ambient noise) at each receiver, and the operating modes of each wind turbine. A sample data set can be downloaded for this purpose. The user can also set the time interval for analysis; it is recommended to keep the time interval constant. Operating Modes : The operating modes for wind turbines expect integer values ranging from 0 for the first operating mode to ( n ) for the weakest operating mode. Dates should be entered in the format DD/MM/YY HH:MM. Time-series Analysis : The application calculates the noise impact for each time interval at each receiver. Results are displayed in a noise timeline chart, helping engineers better understand the noise impact according to the time of day or week and identify noise impact patterns. Direct and Inverse Methode : Direct Methode : The input data set considers residual noise; impacts are calculated, and ambient noises are derived. Inverse Methode : The input data set considers ambient noise; impacts are calculated, and residual noises are derived. Special cases where the calculated induced noise level is higher than the measured ambient noise may occur. In these cases, the model assumes a residual noise 10 dB(A) lower than the ambient noise. Benefits This application aids engineers in studying the temporal evolution of the noise impact of a wind farm and making data-driven decisions to minimize noise impact. Mesh The Mesh application within the Eolyse workspace is designed to enable cartographic noise impact mapping for wind farms. Key Features Grid Creation : Users can create a grid of points where the wind farm's noise impact will be calculated. The grid or mesh is limited to 40,000 points and is centered by default on the centroid of the wind farm's layout. Mesh Configuration : Users can adjust the length of the square mesh and its resolution through the parameters \"Mesh Length on X-axis\" and \"Resolution\" in the Mesh parameter panel. Wind Direction & Period : Users can select one wind direction. While topography is currently not available (work in progress), two types of periods\u2014day and night\u2014can be configured. Computation Time : The duration of the calculation depends on both the number of sources and the size of the mesh. Result Visualization Mapbox Integration : The 'Result' sub-tab provides a Mapbox-based map that displays the noise impact on a color scale ranging from 0 to 100 dB(A), in steps of 5 dB(A). Wind Speed Classes : Calculations are run for standardized wind classes between 8 and 12 m/s.
